# speechsynthesizer
For this project I created a Speech Synthesizer python program. 
The program  takes an input phrase and synthesises it. 
Tasks Involved: 
- Normalize input tex 
- Convert word sequence to a phone sequence
- Concatenate the monophone wav files together in the right order to produce synthesised audio

Extending the functionality with:
- Volume control
- Pauses based on punctuation
- Text normalization for numbers.
